# Data-Science-Analytics-Internship-Tasks
=========================================

This repository contains a collection of data science and analytics tasks completed as part of an internship. Each task is designed to enhance practical skills in data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning, and model evaluation using real-world datasets.

Folder Structure
----------------
Each task is organized in its own folder with a separate README.txt and relevant files:

1. Task1_Iris_Dataset
   - Exploring and visualizing the Iris dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. Task2_Credit_Risk_Prediction
   - Binary classification model to predict loan default risk using logistic regression and decision trees.

3. Task3_Customer_Churn_Prediction
   - Classification model to identify customers likely to leave a bank, with encoding and feature importance analysis.

4. Task4_Insurance_Charges_Prediction
   - Linear regression model to estimate insurance charges based on personal data. Evaluated using MAE and RMSE.

5. Task5_Personal_Loan_Acceptance
   - Predicting customer response to personal loan offers using classification models and business insights.

Skills Practiced
----------------
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Categorical feature encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, MAE, RMSE
- Business insight extraction and feature importance analysis

Tools & Libraries
-----------------
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
